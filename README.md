✅ Consumer groups: List all your active consumer groups along with their active group offsets, edit group offsets (by group, topic or partition) or delete a consumer group.

✅ Topic overview: Browse through the list of your Kafka topics, check their configuration, space usage, list all consumers who consume a single topic or watch partition details (such as low and high water marks, message count, ...), embed topic documentation from a git repository and more.

✅ Cluster overview: List vailable brokers, their space usage, rack id, health, configuration and other information to get a high level overview of your brokers in your cluster.

✅ Security: Create, list or edit Kafka ACLs and SASL-SCRAM users.
